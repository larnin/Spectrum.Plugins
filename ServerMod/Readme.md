#### __!! ServerMod works for stable versions 5070, 5073 !!__  

ServerMod is a plugin that adds some commands to the server, accessible by the host and players.
All the commands are prefixed by '!'.
If you are a client and you have the plugin, you can use your commands by remplacing the '!' key to '%' 

Commands have 3 permission levels:
* __HOST__: Only the host can use the command
* __ALL__: All players can use the command
* __LOCAL__: Client-side command

Some commands with __ALL__ permission level can also be used when you are a client.  

__Playlist managing commands can't be used on trackmogrify mode (trackmogrify don't use playlist).__ 

# Command list (alphabetized):

#### Auto:
Permission: __HOST__  
Use: !auto  
Toggle the server auto mode.  
When auto mode is activated, the server will automatically jump to the next level when all players finish.  
If a level lasts longer than 15 minutes, the server continues to the next level.  
If the playlist ends, the server goes back to the lobby automatically.  
Auto mode doesn't work with Trackmogrify.

#### Autospec:
